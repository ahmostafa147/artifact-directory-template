Title:
Radiographic Enhanced Clinical Decision Support System for Early Sepsis Detection and Risk Assessment

Abstract:
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the bodyâ€™s extreme response
to an infection. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving
patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a radiographic enhanced clin-
ical decision support system for early sepsis detection and risk assessment.
The system leverages chest X-ray images and patient metadata to predict the
probability of sepsis development within specific time frames after the X-ray
is taken.
The proposed pipeline consists of two main components: 1) A ResNet model
that predicts lung anomalies based solely on chest X-ray images, and 2) A
neural network model that combines the output of the first model with patient
vitals and other relevant metadata to estimate the likelihood of sepsis onset
within 1, 2, or 3+ days.
The project involves extensive data engineering to preprocess and integrate
the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets. The team is also building a cloud-
based infrastructure using AWS services such as S3, ECS, and CloudFront to
deploy the models and create a user-friendly web interface for demonstration
and presentation purposes.
This report focuses on the progress made by the sub-team responsible for
the radiographic enhanced clinical decision support system, highlighting the
contributions of Ahmed Mostafa, Boqi (Bobby) Zhu, and Tongxun (Sherry)
Hu.
